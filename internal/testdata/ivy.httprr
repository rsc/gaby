Also fix a few small\r\nsemantic problems in the process.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nIndexing a vector by a vector produces a vector nearly all the time.\r\nThis CL changes that to all the time, so that programs can have a\r\nconsistent expectation about the rank of the result and whether\r\nit can be indexed. For example, suppose we have a vector of values\r\nand want to extract the positive ones, extract those indexes from\r\na vector v, and then sort v.\r\n\r\n\tv = v[(x > 0) sel x]\r\n\tv = v[up v]\r\n\r\n(x > 0) sel x is always a vector. If it has length > 1, then v[(x > 0) sel x]\r\nis always a vector. But if it has length == 1, then before this CL,\r\nv[(x > 0) sel x] was a scalar, not a vector, making the indexing in\r\nv[up v] disallowed.\r\n\r\nThe shrinking of v in the single-element vector case was important\r\nbecause it made v[1] be a scalar: the code promoted both v and i\r\nin v[i] to the same overall type, meaning the scalar 1 was promoted\r\nto a vector 1, and then v[1] needed to drop the result back to scalar\r\nto be useful. Taking advantage of the recently added ability to have\r\ndifferent types for the two parts, this CL drops the promotion and\r\nthen preserves the form.\r\n\r\nThere were also a few other lesser surprises arising from promoting\r\nboth v and i in v[i] to the same overall type. For example (before this CL):\r\n\r\n\t1[1]\r\n\r\n\t1[1 2 3]\r\n\r\nNow both of those are diagnosed as erroneous.\r\n\r\nThese semantic problems are now tested, and the cleanup and changes\r\ndid not affect any existing test, suggesting that all the important\r\nbehaviors have been preserved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/86","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/86/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/86/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/86/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/86","id":1096839227,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAZPgIc4wr2Db","number":86,"title":"ivy: add x[i;j;k] indexing syntax, including vector-indexed assignment","user":{"login":"rsc","id":104030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc","html_url":"https://github.com/rsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2022-01-08T05:23:46Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T15:12:33Z","closed_at":"2022-01-09T00:59:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/pulls/86","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/86","diff_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/86.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/86.patch","merged_at":"2022-01-09T00:59:18Z"},"body":"This PR has two commits. \r\n\r\nThe first changes multidimensional indexing syntax from x[i][j][k] to x[i;

Some others such as `log` and binary `**` don't converge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/98/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/98/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/99","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/99/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/99/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/99/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/99","id":1104240594,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAZPgIc4xEPlk","number":99,"title":"value: prevent trig function endless loops for infinite argument","user":{"login":"glxxyz","id":12117022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE3MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12117022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz","html_url":"https://github.com/glxxyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-01-15T00:39:50Z","updated_at":"2022-01-15T08:01:10Z","closed_at":"2022-01-15T08:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/pulls/99","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/99","diff_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/99.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/99.patch","merged_at":"2022-01-15T08:01:10Z"},"body":"sin, cos, and tan of infinity all looped endlessly inside twoPiReduce.\r\n\r\nPartial fix for #98 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/94","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/94/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/94/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/94/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/94","id":1101942848,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAZPgIc4w8TpK","number":94,"title":"ivy: fix )save of new index expression, multiline functions","user":{"login":"rsc","id":104030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc","html_url":"https://github.com/rsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-01-13T15:32:29Z","updated_at":"2022-01-16T09:48:51Z","closed_at":"2022-01-16T09:48:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/pulls/94","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/94","diff_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/94.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/94.patch","merged_at":"2022-01-16T09:48:51Z"},"body":"The new index expression was not accounted for in the\r\nreference walk.

first, which I preserved from the binary case.\r\nBut it also shows that in `+/ (f 1) (f 2)` and `g (f 1) (f 2)`, `(f 1)` runs first.\r\n\r\nThis confused me because to use a complex\r\nexpression multiple times,\r\nthe idiom from APL is something like\r\n\r\n    m+m=complex thing\r\n\r\nbut it turns out to use it multiple times in a vector its the other way around:\r\n\r\n    +/ (m=complex thing) m \r\n  \r\nIs this correct?\r\nIs it documented somewhere?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/95/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/95/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/97","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/97/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/97/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/97/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/97","id":1104047351,"node_id":"I_kwDOAZPgIc5Bzmz3","number":97,"title":"Possible

Or maybe not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/108","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/108/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/108/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/108/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/108","id":1140323474,"node_id":"I_kwDOAZPgIc5D9_SS","number":108,"title":"For A in [-2, 0) and B an even number, A**B returns 1","user":{"login":"n-riesco","id":6199391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTkzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6199391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco","html_url":"https://github.com/n-riesco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-riesco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2022-02-16T17:08:18Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T21:48:04Z","closed_at":"2022-02-16T21:48:04Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"```\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.17.7 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n$ go install robpike.io/ivy@latest\r\ngo: downloading robpike.io/ivy v0.2.6\r\n\r\n$ ivy\r\n-0.01 -0.1 -0.2 -0.21 -0.201 -0.3 ** 0\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n\r\n-0.01 -0.1 -0.2 -0.21 -0.201 -0.3 ** 1\r\n-1/100 -1/10 -1/5 -21/100 -201/1000 -3/10\r\n\r\n-0.01 -0.1 -0.2 -0.21 -0.201 -0.3 ** 2\r\n1 1 1 441/10000 40401/1000000 9/100\r\n\r\n-0.01 -0.1 -0.2 -0.21 -0.201 -0.3 ** 3\r\n-1/100 -1/10 -1/5 -9261/1000000 -8120601/1000000000 -27/1000\r\n\r\n-0.01 -0.1 -0.2 -0.21 -0.201 -0.3 ** 4\r\n1 1 1 194481/100000000 1632240801/1000000000000 81/10000\r\n\r\n-0.01 -0.1 -0.2 -0.21 -0.201 -0.3 ** 6\r\n1 1 1 85766121/1000000000000 65944160601201/1000000000000000000 729/1000000\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}]179 127451

Why the precedence is left to right, why not `1/(2/3)` ?\r\n- `1/2/3/4` is the same as `(1/2)/(3/4)`, but `//1 2 3 4` is `1/(2/(3/4))`, three divisions, which is not the same.\r\n\r\nI can guess that the scanner works left to right  and if it finds a fraction, it grabs it.\r\nIMO this creates some inconsistency between fractions and divisions.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was to simply abandon the \"fraction meaning\" and to consider only divisions, where a fraction is just the result of a division of integers. But in this case `1 2/3` will be `(1 2)/3 == (1/3) (2/3)` and not `1 (2/3)`.

@ operator modifier is a bit like APL's each/map.\r\nApplied to the left or right of an operator, it produces an operator\r\nthat applies to each element of its left or right argument and then\r\nreturns an array of those results.\r\n\r\nFor example consider a vector of x,y points and the operator\r\ncomputing the Manhattan distance between two points:\r\n\r\n\td = 3 2 rho iota 6\r\n\r\n\top x dist y = +/ abs x-y\r\n\r\n\t0 0 dist d\r\n\t3 7 11\r\n\r\nWhat if we want the Manhattan distance between all pairs of points?\r\nThis is a kind of outer product but only matching pairs of points;\r\nthe actual outer product matches all pairs of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe outer product does 'for all' over all dimensions of its\r\nleft and right arguments, while @ only does 'for all' over a\r\nsingle dimension of the argument on the side where the @ appears.\r\nSo the pairwise Manhattan distances of the points is @dist@:\r\n\r\n\td @dist@ d\r\n\t0 4 8\r\n\t4 0 4\r\n\t8 4 0\r\n\r\nWhat if we have a binary operator and want to apply it with\r\na fixed left argument to each of a list of left or right arguments?\r\nIn this example, because Manhattan distance only uses +/,

But looping and conditionals are not available.\n\nI may do something about that one day but have no plans to do so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/226816093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/226893441","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/28#issuecomment-226893441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/28","id":226893441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjg5MzQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"benjamin-rood","id":10102132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAyMTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10102132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood","html_url":"https://github.com/benjamin-rood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamin-rood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-17T22:10:07Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T22:10:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the response.

In fact, as far as I researched, you even wrote a demo in HTML a while back which I recently found somewhere! I may expand on this html/css demo. The issue with a terminal compared to a proper GUI is it is simply much harder to expand upon and utilize efficiently: say I want to add a gui Button for commonly used maths, or to store values.   \r\n\r\nCalculators have buttons: you can \"store\" certain values in memory, as an example, then recall them later. Or calculators have buttons to show you functions you wouldn't remember otherwise. Doing this at a terminal still is possible, but... I prefer to have a GUI for some things.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for Ivy, I'm needing to work with some massive numbers right now :-)\r\n\r\nI'll likely make my own HTML 5 /css demo, possibly based on shurcooL's code if that is in fact yours that I found.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to reopen this issue: this is just a comment.

If you could define something like `op x(1) f y(1)` to mean that f can't handle more than a vector, then something like `z f z` could automatically figure out that it needs to iterate over axes until both sides are down to vectors, even more like +.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/989381362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/989385417","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/28#issuecomment-989385417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/28","id":989385417,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc46-NLJ","user":{"login":"rsc","id":104030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc","html_url":"https://github.com/rsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T01:25:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T01:25:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I noticed this is still open, presumably because of the 'need an Ivy discussion forum' part since the conditional execution now exists.

implemented @ in my copy of my Ivy, but I haven't sent it out. The implementation needs work and I don't know if it's the right idea anyway. \r\n\r\nBut it has one property that seems pretty nice. I was wrong about what `xs @op@ ys` would mean. I had said it would run op on corresponding pairs of x and y and collect the results, but that's inconsistent with the single-@ cases. If `xs @op y` means \"for all x in xs, x op y\" and \"x op@ ys\" means \"for all y in ys, x op y\", then the only consistent meaning of `xs @op@ ys` is \"for all x in xs, for all y in ys, x op y\". That is, it's an outer product, at least if xs and ys are vectors. More generally, `x @...@op@...@ y` is the outer product when the number of @'s on the left equals the rank of x and the number on the right equals the rank of y.\r\n\r\nAfter using this for a few days ([for example, here in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfC2ggsnpw&list=PLrwpzH1_9ufMLOB6BAdzO08Qx-9jHGfGg&index=13&t=70s)) I find it much easier to think of the outer product this way. I never really got used to `o.==` but seeing `@==@` as two loops works much better for me. \r\n\r\nRob's comment about map not being needed for the basic operators is absolutely true: they all automatically extend to vectors well already. It is far more useful for user-defined operators, which are often defined in ways that don't automatically extend to vectors ([for example, later in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfC2ggsnpw&list=PLrwpzH1_9ufMLOB6BAdzO08Qx-9jHGfGg&index=13&t=550s)).\r\n\r\nOne basic operator that does benefit is transp. If you have, say, a 5 16 16 called x, interpreted as 5 16x16 matrices and you want to transpose them all, you can (now) do 1 3 2 transp x, but transp@ x is a bit clearer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/995386616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/995899352","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/78#issuecomment-995899352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/78","id":995899352,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc47XDfY","user":{"login":"rsc","id":104030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc","html_url":"https://github.com/rsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-16T15:03:09Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T15:03:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FWIW,

is an interesting idea, but I am not sure it's a worthwhile path to take. To do it, it must be done well, which is a lot of work. The transcendental functions and logarithms must work, not to mention the surprising challenge of division.\r\n\r\nBut leaving aside whether to do it at all, this is not the best way to introduce them. The parsing problems introduced by using Go's notation here are severe.\r\n\r\nOn my morning constitutional I thought about the problem and realized that the right APL way (and hence ivy way) is to use operators. I thought of 'i' for the operator, but that is stealing a very common variable, so I decided that 'j' would be better, as the electrical engineers use.  Then the unary 'j' returns an imaginary number, or perhaps just multiplies its argument by sqrt(-1). The binary 'j' takes a  real and an imaginary part:\r\n\r\n```\r\nj 3 == (0+3i)\r\n2 j 4 == (2+3i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has a strong analogy with how rationals are built, by overloading (but not really) the / operator. As with rationals, the lexer could promote the form directly and avoid most of the parsing mess.  Then you get things like this to work well:\r\n\r\n```\r\nj iota 3 == (0+1i) (0+2i) (0+3i)\r\n2 j iota 3 = (2+1i) (2+2i) (2+3i)\r\n1j1 2j2 3j3 == (1+1i) (2+2i) (3+3i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so on. If you executed those, you wouldn't get Go notation of course:\r\n\r\n```\r\nj iota 3 \r\n   0j1 0j2 0j3\r\n\r\n2 j iota 3\r\n   2j1 2j2 2j3\r\n\r\n1j1 2j2 3j3\r\n   1j1 2j2 3j3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I looked up what dyalog did, and at least for syntax, guess what? 2J3 is their notation for 2+3i. So that is an endorsement of my suggestion.\r\n\r\nBut to go back to the main point, thank you for suggesting the idea, but this is not the way to go, and I'm not sure it's worth doing at all, because the work involved is substantial. Introducing a new basic type into ivy is hard enough; doing it for such an unusual type is all the more work.\r\n\r\nSo I am going to close this PR, but I promise to think hard about doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1009608277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1012225874","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/92#issuecomment-1012225874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/92","id":1012225874,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc48VVdS","user":{"login":"rsc","id":104030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc","html_url":"https://github.com/rsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T15:10:27Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T15:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No worries at all if you'd rather not, but it seemed like this might be worth making a little less invisible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1012225874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1012346400","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/90#issuecomment-1012346400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/90","id":1012346400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc48Vy4g","user":{"login":"glxxyz","id":12117022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE3MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12117022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz","html_url":"https://github.com/glxxyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glxxyz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T17:22:17Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T17:24:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for taking a look.

That was not strictly necessary but fell out easily.\r\n\r\nI haven't made it a PR, both because the approach is not decided and because it depends on the )save fix PR, and that seemed too confusing to have the )save fix commit appear in two different PRs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1012418172/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1012422932","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/95#issuecomment-1012422932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/95","id":1012422932,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc48WFkU","user":{"login":"rsc","id":104030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc","html_url":"https://github.com/rsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T19:02:32Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T19:49:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Occurred to me I could look at TryAPL, which behaves differently from Ivy.

we not panic in [`value.Errorf`](https://github.com/robpike/ivy/blob/v0.2.7/value/value.go#L54)?\r\nIn particular, [`value.index`](https://github.com/robpike/ivy/blob/v0.2.7/value/index.go#L47) already does bounds checking, so repanicking seems wierd.\r\n\r\nBy the way, sincere gratitude for creating this wonderful piece of software!!\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>A bit of background why I prefer not panicking</summary>\r\n  \r\n  I actually want to use ivy as a script language embedded in a Go programme.\r\n  The Go programme is doing image manipulation on [Gerber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format) images.\r\n  In particular, it is trying to match parts of an image to a golden image.\r\n  Due to the fragmentation of the PCB industry, there are myriad ways how our suppliers\r\n  describe their manufactured parts.\r\n  I can't handle all these different ways, so I am thinking of letting operators figure out the image mapping with their own eyeballs, and script it out to the programme.\r\n  You may ask why not simply let operators input three numbers denoting the X, Y translations and theta for rotation.\r\n  This is because in order to increase mechanical efficiency, some parts may contain multiple heads and work on many units simulatenously.\r\n  In other words, the image mapping is something like:\r\n  ```\r\n  op panel p = \r\n    p[0] > 0 && p[1] > 0: p[0]*cos(theta) + p[1]*sin(theta)\r\n    p[0] < 0 && p[1] > 0: ...\r\n    ... \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  I was initially thinking of using https://github.com/pkujhd/goloader to allow operators to write in Go, but hacking Go's linker seems to fragile.\r\n  Then I thought of `GOARCH=wasm`, but moving slices in and out of wasm is a pain in the ass.\r\n  Moreover, `GOARCH=wasm` in it's current state is not much faster than an interpreter.\r\n  In the end, I found ivy, which seems suited for these kinds of mathematical tasks.\r\n  However, if ivy's `value.Errorf` panics, I would need to `recover` which feels like I am commiting a sin.\r\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1120610743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1120727724","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/28#issuecomment-1120727724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/28","id":1120727724,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc5CzPKs","user":{"login":"robpike","id":4324516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T07:14:30Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T07:14:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"`value.Errorf`

A fraction will just be the result of a division and all precedence rules will be respected. \r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it last night, my proposal is more of a compromise between the current behavior (scanning for fractions first and avoiding parentheses in vectors) and the more lengthy to type, but unambiguous, case without fraction separators. \r\n\r\nIMO, we can consider `/` as a fraction separator **only** in a vector of length greater than 1, not a simple number. In all other cases consider it as a division.\r\n\r\nExamples : \r\n- `2/3 + 4` is considered as `2/(3+4)` in the same way as `2*3+4` is `14` and not `10`;\r\n- `1 2/3 + 4` is considered as `(1 2/3) + 4` as it is actually, because `2/3` is part of the vector `1 2/3`;\r\n- `1/2 3 + 4` is considered as `(1/2 3) + 4` as it is actually, because `1/2` is part of the vector `1/2 3`;\r\n- `1/2/3` have two divisions and not a fraction, and is the same as `//1 2 3`; \r\n\r\nThis is a simple idea and there are probably some corner cases, or the way the scanner works, that make this change impossible. And of course there is the backwards compatibility.

for the update.\r\n\r\nYour solution to the matrix operation is quite expensive, both in CPU time and in allocations. I believe that because of the way memory is laid out in matrices, which is not accidental, this can be done more efficiently. Also, there are some secondary operations that might be worth adding, either internally or explicitly in what is available to the user. There should probably be a equality operator for matrix and vector comparisons, and perhaps also a hash function.\r\n\r\nLet me think about these for a while.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1600051921/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1603481239","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/pull/129#issuecomment-1603481239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/129","id":1603481239,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc5fky6X","user":{"login":"robpike","id":4324516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpike/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-23T00:43:21Z","updated_at":"2023-06-23T00:43:50Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Here's my thinking so far.\r\n\r\nIt bothers me that your vector and matrix implementations are so different. They should be able to share a lot of their operation. But some pieces are missing to make that possible, such as general equality and general ordering. They could be provided, maybe.\r\n\r\nAlso, the \"unique\" operation in APL is declared as a monadic version of a general set operation. (I forget which one, but it doesn't matter for the moment.) Ivy should also have set operations, but to provide union and intersection would require similar mechanisms to what unique needs.\r\n\r\nThe key to all this is, I think, efficient search within a slice of Values.

Most relevant here, you can't put a Value in a map and be ivy-correct about the results because the (in effect) == operator used by the Go map implementation has different semantics than ivy's. For instance: (float 1) == 1 in ivy, but the comparison will yield false in the interface comparison used in map lookup. And that's leaving aside the panic that will occur should a Vector show up in the map.\r\n\r\nThis is turning into a bit of a rabbit hole but I have a handle on things now, and plan to add union, intersection, unique, and perhaps whole-object comparison operations (not element-wise). I have some of it working, if slowly, and once it's passing all the tests I'll see what I can do about making it fast, which may require some structural changes. And doing it with minimal code duplication is another challenge.

I presume you're using Unix in some form, because otherwise I believe none of this will work.\r\n\r\nOne thing to understand (it's really subtle, and I am still missing some nuance; read on) is how time.Location works in Go. They are not time zones per se, they are locations in which time can be determined. Have a look:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% ivy\r\n)timezone\r\nAEST 36000\r\n\r\n)timezone \"EST\"\r\n\r\n)timezone\r\nEST -14400\r\n\r\n)timezone \"EDT\"\r\n\r\n)timezone\r\nEDT -14400\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, note that my timezone, AEST, prints correctly. That's a property of the system, somehow, and for the life of me I can't figure out where it comes from.\r\n\r\nSecond, note that it knows about EST and EDT but both print with the same offset, which is actually the _current_ offset to UTC at the location in which EST is a valid time zone, e.g. New York. You can see this happening a bit in the test suite, which asks the time at the Unix epoch. The test has the wrong offset for that date, and will break when the US goes back to standard time. I should probably have commented that, and will return to it then.\r\n\r\nThird, I can't explain why you see zero for CEST, but on my machine CEST is not a known zone so I can't get ivy into that state. I can do this though:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% ivy\r\n)timezone \"GMT\"\r\n\r\n)timezone\r\nGMT 3600\r\n\r\n)timezone \"UTC\"\r\n\r\n)timezone\r\nUTC 0\r\n\r\n)timezone \"Europe/Paris\"\r\n\r\n)timezone\r\nEurope/Paris 7200\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry that and see what you get. You could also try setting the TZ environment variable and explore what happens then.\r\n\r\nDespite this explanation, I do believe there are bugs, I just don't know how to deal with the inconsistencies in the timezone database and its interaction with what the local system says.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1736543319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/comments/1736789781","html_url":"https://github.com/robpike/ivy/issues/158#issuecomment-1736789781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robpike/ivy/issues/158","id":1736789781,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZPgIc5nhU8V","user":{"login":"fzipp","id":598327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODMyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp","html_url":"https://github.com/fzipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzipp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-27T06:38:03Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T08:28:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm using macOS.

ecosystem do which is turn off by default and enable it with a flag, while doing this i also merge an old change i made to stop printing an extra new line when reading stdin from pipes, this saves an extra `| sed` i had to use to remove them, but the only annoying piece is the slowdown to exit ivy, i'm ok if you just cherry-pick this
